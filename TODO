* Final Lisp Mapping

-  marshal should signal CORBA:MARSHAL on type errors.

-  (deftype corba:environment() 'corba:exception)

-  typedefs Flags, Identifier? Are all names in CORBA package?
  can NamedValue be defined as a specialised corba struct?

-  (corba:funcall op obj z) ~= (clorb:invoke obj op z)
But lots of variantions possible in operation name. And also
exceptions should be returned not raised.



* Misc

- string_to_object
  Should handle more URL variants: corbname:

- DynAny interface (5.16)

- POAManager: must keep a list of managed POAs. Implement
  wait_for_completion flag by adding a wati-for-completion method to
  POA.

- POA need to keep track of executing requests. wait-for-completion
  method .. does it make sense in a single threaded impl?




* Future

- Multi-Threading

- Values types

- IIOP 1.1

- Connection management: The mapping from <host, port> to a network
  stream could be done with a weak mapping (weak hash?) and perhaps
  some finalization to close the stream. The CORBA:Object could
  contain a field for the assigned network stream. The connection to
  the server could then be closed when there is no more objects from
  that server.
