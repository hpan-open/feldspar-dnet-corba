* Final Lisp Mapping

-  marshal should signal CORBA:MARSHAL on type errors.

- 3.4 (deftype corba:environment() 'corba:exception)

- 3.5 typedefs Flags, Identifier? Are all names in CORBA package? YES

- 3.9.1 (corba:funcall op obj z) ~= (clorb:invoke obj op z)
But lots of variantions possible in operation name. And also
exceptions should be returned not raised.



* Misc

- DynAny interface (3.13)

- POA need to keep track of executing requests. wait-for-completion
  method .. does it make sense in a single threaded impl?




* Future

- Multi-Threading

- IIOP 1.2

- Connection management: The mapping from <host, port> to a network
  stream could be done with a weak mapping (weak hash?) and perhaps
  some finalization to close the stream. The CORBA:Object could
  contain a field for the assigned network stream. The connection to
  the server could then be closed when there is no more objects from
  that server.
