- string_to_object
Should handle more URL variants:
       corbname:, http:

Then change the *name-service*, *interface-repository*
to be something that can be passed to string_to_object.
Like: "file:///tmp/NameService"
       
- Support INS
  -ORBInitRef <ObjectID>=<ObjectURL>


* Final Lisp Mapping

- 2.2 marshal should signal CORBA:MARSHAL on type errors.

- 2.3.1 corba:boolean changed to generalized boolean

- 2.3.1 spec error? "unsigned short" -> "corba:unsigned short"
                    "unsigned long"  -> "corba:unsigned long"

- 5.4 (deftype corba:environment() 'corba:exception)

- 5.5 typedefs Flags, Identifier? Are all names in CORBA package?
  can NamedValue be defined as a specialised corba struct?

- 5.6 ?

- 5.9 (corba:funcall op obj z) ~= (clorb:invoke obj op z)
But lots of variantions possible in operation name. And also
exceptions should be returned not raised.

- 5.12 CORBA:ORBid,
  (CORBA:ORB_init argv orb_identifier ) -> ORB, argv'
  (CORBA:ORB_init ) = (CORBA:ORB_init nil "") -> ORB

- 6.6 CodeGen: class-SERVANT implements all attributes

- 6.7.1 corba:define-method -- a little more advandced than clorb:define-method


* Misc

- Mapping for UserExceptions

- Marshalling of fixed

- unmarshalling of floats

- Bounds cheking on marshaling bounded sequences.

- DynAny interface (5.16)

- IDL parser


* Future

- Multi-Threading

- Values types

- IIOP 1.1

- Consider rewriting TypeCode to use CLOS better, and then making
  marshal/unmarshal generic functions dispatching on the TypeCode
  class

- Connection management: The mapping from <host, port> to a network
  stream could be done with a weak mapping (weak hash?) and perhaps
  some finalization to close the stream. The CORBA:Object could
  contain a field for the assigned network stream. The connection to
  the server could then be closed when there is no more objects from
  that server.
